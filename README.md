I found it interesting that there is still work to be done after raterizing the image. At first this didnt make sense to me since it seems like it should all be done before translating into pixels, but the reading made what is actually being done more clear. 
I didnt know that the onboard ram on a GPU was called the frame buffer. It makes sense now that I think about it though.
